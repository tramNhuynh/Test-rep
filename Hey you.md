Tram Huynh is an artist, a problem solver, and a team player. She completed her Bachelor’s of Science in Biology at Seattle University, then she accomplished her goal of a dental degree at the University of Washington.  She has enjoyed the mental rigor and the instant gratification of being able to use her hand skills to reconstruct broken teeth and address oral health concerns. She has learned a wealth about how she wants to contribute to society and ready to make the leap into programming. She is driven and wants to gain a mastery of software building processes to be able to create what doesn’t exist, and develop new ways to interact with a problem to ultimately make the world a better place.
